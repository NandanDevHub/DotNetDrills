# Access Specifiers, Boxing, Strings

In C#, **Access Specifiers** (`public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`) define the visibility and accessibility of classes and members, supporting encapsulation. **Boxing** converts value types to reference types (e.g., `int` to `object`), while **Unboxing** reverses that process. **Strings** are immutable text objects, ideal for simple operations. For more efficient and frequent string modifications, **StringBuilder** is used, as it allows mutable string manipulation without creating multiple objects.
