# Can Abstract Methods Be Declared as Private?

> **No, abstract methods cannot be declared as private.**

***

#### Why?

* Abstract methods are meant to be **implemented (overridden) by derived classes**.
* If an abstract method were private, **derived classes would not have access to it**, so they couldn’t override it.
* Therefore, abstract methods must be declared as **public**, **protected**, or **protected internal** — any access modifier that allows derived classes to see and implement them.

#### Key Points:

| Access Modifier | Can Abstract Method Have It? | Reason                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **private**     | No                           | Derived classes cannot override private members           |
| **public**      | Yes                          | Visible to all, can be overridden                         |
| **protected**   | Yes                          | Visible to derived classes only                           |
| **internal**    | Yes                          | Visible within assembly (usually combined with protected) |

#### Example: Valid Abstract Method

```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    protected abstract void MakeSound();  // Allowed: derived classes must implement
}
```

***

#### Example: Invalid Abstract Method (private)

```csharp
abstract class Animal
{
    private abstract void MakeSound();  // Compile-time error: Cannot be private
}
```

***

#### Interview Tip:

> Remember, abstract methods define a contract that **derived classes must fulfill**, so they must be accessible to derived classes — hence cannot be private.
