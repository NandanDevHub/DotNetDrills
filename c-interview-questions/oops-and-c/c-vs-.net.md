# C# vs .NET

## Difference Between C# and .NET

**Interview-Ready Answer:**

> **C#** is a **programming language** developed by Microsoft.
>
> **.NET**, on the other hand, is a **framework and runtime environment** that supports multiple languages, including C#. It consists of:
>
> * The **.NET Framework** or **.NET Core/.NET 5+**: which provides a vast **class library** (types like `Console`, `List<T>`, `HttpClient`, etc.)
> * The **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**: which is the **execution engine** where C# code runs (handles memory, exceptions, garbage collection, etc.)
>
> So, C# is the language, and .NET is the ecosystem in which that language usually operates.

| Term                                  | Why it's important in an interview                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **C#**                                | Language you write your logic in                       |
| **.NET Framework / .NET Core / .NET** | Provides base libraries and runtime                    |
| **CLR**                               | Executes compiled C# code (.exe or .dll)               |
| **FCL (Framework Class Library)**     | Collection of prebuilt classes, e.g., `System.Console` |
| **IL (Intermediate Language)**        | What C# compiles into before running on CLR            |

#### Example Breakdown

**âž¤ Code 1: Just a Class**

```csharp
class Example { }
```

* Written in C#
* Even if it _looks_ like it doesn't use .NET, it actually **inherits** from `System.Object` implicitly.
* That means **every C# class** derives from .NET base class library (`System.Object`) unless youâ€™re in very low-level environments.

**âž¤ Code 2: Uses .NET Explicitly**

```csharp
class Example
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.Write("hello, world");
    }
}
```

* Written in C#
* Uses **`System.Console.Write`**, which comes from **.NET Framework Class Library**.
* Shows **how C# and .NET work together** in practical terms.
* `Main()` is the **entry point** of a C# program.
* `System.Console` is a **.NET type**, fully qualified with namespace `System`.

&#x20;Real-World Analogy

> Think of **C# as English**, and **.NET as the library + stage** where you speak that language.
>
> You can form sentences (C# code), but if there's no one listening (no runtime like CLR) or no dictionary (no class library like .NET), it's hard to make anything useful.

***

#### Deep Understanding: Why it's hard to use C# without .NET?

Because:

* All **C# data types** (e.g., `int`, `string`, `List<T>`) map to .NET types (`System.Int32`, `System.String`, `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>`)
* The **runtime (CLR)** is needed to run C# apps (unless you're using special tools like AOT compilation or IL2CPP in Unity)
* Your code is compiled into **IL code**, not native machine code. CLR is needed to interpret and execute that.

## Common Language Runtime (CLR)

#### What is CLR?

* CLR is the **runtime environment** provided by .NET to **execute programs written in .NET languages** (like C#, VB.NET, F#).
* Itâ€™s often called the **virtual machine** of .NET.
* It handles:
  * **Memory management** (allocating and freeing memory)
  * **Garbage collection** (automatic memory cleanup)
  * **Type safety**
  * **Exception handling**
  * **Security**
  * **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**

#### CLR Responsibilities in Detail

| Responsibility              | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution of IL code**    | Converts IL (Intermediate Language) into machine code at runtime via JIT compiler                  |
| **Memory management**       | Allocates managed heap, manages object lifetimes, and performs garbage collection                  |
| **Type safety enforcement** | Ensures code only accesses memory and types safely, preventing buffer overflows or type mismatches |
| **Exception handling**      | Manages structured exception handling in managed code                                              |
| **Security**                | Enforces Code Access Security (CAS) policies                                                       |
| **Interoperability**        | Facilitates calling native code (COM, Win32) and other unmanaged code                              |

## ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Language (IL) â€” Also called MSIL or CIL

#### What is IL?

* When you compile C# code, **it does NOT become machine code directly**.
* Instead, it compiles into **IL code** â€” a CPU-independent set of instructions.
* IL code is stored in **assemblies** (DLL or EXE files).
* This IL is then **JIT-compiled** by CLR at runtime into machine code specific to the CPU architecture.

***

#### Why Intermediate Language?

* **Portability**: Same IL can run on different platforms with appropriate CLR implementations.
* **Language interoperability**: Multiple languages (C#, VB.NET, F#, etc.) compile down to the same IL, allowing them to work together.
* **Security and Verification**: IL is verifiable before execution, increasing security and reliability.

***

#### Example of IL Viewing (optional)

If you compile this C# code:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello IL");
    }
}
```

You can inspect the IL using a tool like **ILDASM** (Intermediate Language Disassembler). It shows low-level instructions like:

```
vbnetCopyIL_0000: ldstr "Hello IL"
IL_0005: call void [System.Console]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
IL_000a: ret
```

## ðŸ”¹ How C# Compiles to .NET Assemblies

#### Step-by-step process:

1. **Source Code (C#)**: You write human-readable code.
2. **Compiler (csc.exe)**: The C# compiler compiles your code to **IL code**.
3. **Metadata**: The compiler also generates metadata describing types, references, and resources.
4. **Assembly**: The IL code + metadata are bundled into an **assembly** (`.dll` or `.exe`).
5. **Execution**:
   * When you run the assembly, the **CLR loads it**.
   * The CLRâ€™s **JIT compiler** converts IL to **native machine code** for the CPU.
   * The machine code executes on the hardware.

***

#### What is an Assembly?

* Assemblies are the **building blocks of .NET applications**.
* They contain:
  * **IL code**
  * **Metadata** (information about types, members, references)
  * **Manifest** (versioning info, security, culture)
* Types of assemblies:
  * **Executable (.exe)**
  * **Library (.dll)**

***

#### How this all ties in: A Visual Flow

```
C# Source Code --> C# Compiler --> IL + Metadata (Assembly) --> CLR (JIT Compiler) --> Native Machine Code --> Runs on CPU
```
