# Do Interfaces Have Constructors?

**Short answer:**\
**No, interfaces do NOT have constructors.**

***

#### Why not?

* **A constructor is used to create and set up an object.**
* But **you cannot create an object directly from an interface** — interfaces only tell what methods or properties a class should have.
* Since interfaces don’t create objects or hold data, they don’t need constructors.
* Interface can only used for Inheritance
