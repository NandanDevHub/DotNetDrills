# OOPS and C\#

I**ntroduction to OOP and C#**

This page provides a foundational overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts alongside an introduction to the C# programming language. Designed for beginners, it explains the core principles of OOP—such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction—and demonstrates how these concepts are implemented in C#. Whether you’re new to programming or transitioning from another language, this guide helps you understand how C# leverages OOP to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code.
